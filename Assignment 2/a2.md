## Set up

It was written in **C++ 11**. Run by command

``g++ -lm -lcrypt -O2 -std=c++11 -pipe -DONLINE_JUDGE``

It has been accepted by Uva.

## Algorithm overview

1. Grow the string by appending itself

   1. ex. abc => abcabc

2. Build suffix array

   1. Make use the implementation of suffix array in stanford notebook

3. Loop the suffix array from top,  ``suffix.L`` = twice of the original string length

   1. With this method we always get lexigraphically smaller suffix

   2. If the length of the suffix is larger than ``suffix.L/2`` , in another word, it has a prefix of length L, it is what we are looking for.

   3. But there may be the case that multiple suffixs have same length of L prefix, we need to take the lexigraphically larger one among

      1. ex. 

         abcabcabc

         abcabcabcabc

         abcabcabcabcabc

      2. We take the last one since the first "a" has the smallest index in the string

## Implementation detail

1. Loop suffix array from top
   1. Build pair <i,SA[i]> and sort according to SA[i]
   2. If case 3.3 from Algorithm overview shows up, skip the iteration.
